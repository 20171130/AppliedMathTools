Some remarks:
- The time of seminar is not completely determined yet. It will be
discussed and determined in the beginning of the next semester.

Before the material due, person responsible for the topic should:
- Upload, or say push, a source file of a slide of outline. (An article
/ paper is also OK). The outline should cover fundamental ideas of the
topic and should avoid intensive enumeration.
- Upload, or say push, a source file of a list of materials related to
the topic. The list of materials should contain following parts:
    - Hints for configurations and installations.
    - A list of resources related to the topic.
    - Some questions for assignments. Background of required assignments
    should be explained. It is best to attach the solution.
- Set an issue in the original seminar repository to collect suggestions
on the topics.

Before the assignment due, everyone attending the seminar should:
- Choose some resource to read and learn about the topic.
- Finish the required assignments.

In the seminar, person responsible for the topic should:
- Give a brief presentation on the outline of the topic. Questions are
not allowed during the presentation. (due to limited time)
- Hold discussion around the topic.
